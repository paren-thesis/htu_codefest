Style Guide

Layout

All user interfaces must have a header with the logo (Logo_Worldskills_Ghana.png) and a title (exception: simple dialogs).

Ensure that the entire system makes good use of alignment and whitespace.

Elements should be logically grouped for ease of use.

The same design considerations must apply to all user interfaces and windows developed for the system, including forms, reports, letters, and documentation.

Use colors and fonts that guarantee good readability and suit typical screen resolutions.

At least one part of every window must have a background color other than white.

Professionalism

The system must be clean, consistent, visually appealing, and free of spelling and grammatical errors.
